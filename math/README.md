# Math
Implementations of numberical algorithms, such as finding the greatest commmon
divisor, differentiation, integration, etc.

Much of this will be driven by the implementations given in "Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs".

## Algorithms
- [x] Euclid's Algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor
- [x] Fibonacci
- [x] Sigma summation
- [x] Simpson's rule for integrals
- [ ] Function composition ([SICP] 1.43)
- [x] Iterative Improvement of Fixed Point
  - [x] Fixed Point of a Function ([SICP] 1.3.3)
  - [ ] Continued Fractions ([SICP] 1.3.3)
