# Back to School
I've decided to kill four birds with one stone by re-learning computer science
fundamentals _and_ learning Rust, Julia, and Haskell in one go. To this end, I
will implement each data structure, algorithm, or demonstration of a general
concept in all three langugages. Hopefully, there will be synergy between the
reinforcement of repetitive re-implementation and the modeling across languages.
