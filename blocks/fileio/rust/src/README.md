# fileio

Not the simplest thing to jump to after 'hello world'. File I/O requires:

* fileio
    * File system operations
    * Error handling
    * String creation

The basic steps are:

1. Given a filepath, open a file
2. Read its contents to a string or string buffer
3. Test: Check read-in contents for equality to expected.
